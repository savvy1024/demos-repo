# Portfolio Page

The portfolio page contains the following sections:

- A header with external links to social media accounts and internal links to other sections of the page
- A landing section with an avatar picture and a short bio
- A section to display your featured projects as cards in a grid fashion
- A contact me section with a form to allow visitors to contact you

## Libraries Used

### TailwindCSS

### Formik and Yup

The Formik library is already set up in the project as well. In this lab, you will be using the `useFormik` hook from the Formik library, as well as the global `Yup` object to define the Contact Me form validation rules. The form UI will be implemented using Chakra UI components.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Start the app with `npm start`
4. View the app in the browser at `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

The app outputs a page with an empty header, 3 different full-height sections, and a footer. Every section has a different background color. The first 2 sections will be empty and the third section will contain all the UI elements for the Contact Me form.

To customize the portfolio page, update the code in the corresponding files. Use Chakra UI components to build the UI elements and Formik and Yup to handle the Contact Me form validation.
